The code below is very much self explanatory.

We first sort the array of strings.
Then, we choose the first and last string in the array. [They are supposed to be the most different among all the pairs of strings in the sorted array]
We just compare how many common characters match from index i = 0 of these two strings.


 sort(strs.begin(),strs.end());
        int n=strs.size();
    string compare="";
        if(n==1)
            return strs[0];
        int i=0,j=0;
    while(i<strs[0].size() && j<strs[n-1].size())
    {
        if(strs[0][i]==strs[n-1][j])
        {
            compare+=strs[0][i];
            i++;
            j++;
        }
        else
            break;
    }
        return compare;
    }
